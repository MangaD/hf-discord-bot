					'The "2-4-6" task was the first experiment that showed people to be '
					'illogical and irrational. In this study, subjects were told that the '
					'experimenter had a rule in mind that only applied to sets of threes. '
					'The "2-4-6" rule the experimenter had in mind was "any ascending sequence". '
					'In most cases, subjects not only formed hypotheses that were more specific '
					'than necessary, but they also **only tested positive examples** of their '
					'hypothesis. Wason was surprised by the large number of subjects who failed '
					'to get the task correct. The subjects **failed to test instances inconsistent '
					'with their own hypothesis**, which further supported Wasonâ€™s hypothesis '
					'of **confirmation bias**. Confirmation bias is the tendency to search for, '
					'interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms or supports '
					'one\'s prior beliefs or values. It is an important type of cognitive bias '
					'that has a significant effect on the proper functioning of society by '
					'distorting evidence-based decision-making.'
